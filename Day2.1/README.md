# Intro to Pygame

First, we need to download Pygame! For some of you, depending on your operating system versions and environments, we may run into some issues with running pygame that we'll have to troubleshoot later. If so, there are advanced instructions on the [Pygame website](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted). Otherwise, the install should be the same as all the other tools we've used so far:

1. Open the terminal (cmd/ctrl + shift + ~)
1. Run the following command: `python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user` (you may need to change the `python3` to `python`, depending on your environment).
1. To see if it worked, run the following command: `python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens` (note, we are making a game like this on Wednesday and Thursday!).

## Pygame Basics
Update(), Event Handling, Display, Animation

## Activity - Bouncing Ball Challenge

Complete the reflection survey: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xfgaDOUNVwy8Se7UrOAR50UNoc86e315fZEozcnZJxU/edit?usp=sharing

Bouncing Ball Optional Challenge:

This one will really push you... Completion of the first task is required. The subsequent tasks are quite difficult, and will really push your understanding of both physics and animating using Pygame. I encourage you to attempt them, but completing them is a challenge few students are up to. The instructions for this activity can be found on the attached google doc:

1. [Activity 2.1 Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kDGdzlhPN_n7G4WFVAPyTBSfoJbMPV5iXiwB4lnuIuw/edit?usp=sharing)

Method:
	Students follow along as I code the pygameIntro.py file and the firstAnimation.py file. The activity is to code bouncing balls in pygame (assignment description not included in folder)

Learning Goals:

	Introduction to Pygame
	Introduction to Animation
