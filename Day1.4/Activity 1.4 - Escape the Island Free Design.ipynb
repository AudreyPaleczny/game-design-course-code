    "# Activity 1.4 - Escape the Island Free Design\n",
    "\n",
    "This morning we learned all about Classes and Methods, and used them to build a very crude *Escape the Island* adventure game. I'm sure you have tons of ideas about how to make the game better, so this afternoon is your chance to add whatever you want! Here's a few ideas to get you started:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improve the map: The Island Grid has 16 spaces. You could design 16 unique tiles for each of those spaces. Don't forget to include new dangers!\n",
    "2. Improved encounters: Maybe you want the game to be more interesting than static encounters. Perhaps you can make an Encounter class, that let's you do things in encounters like fight, flee, or explore (these sound like methods for the encounter)\n",
    "3. Improved items: Maybe certain items help you survive the island. Maybe if you find a specific combination of items you win the game and escape the island?\n",
    "4. Improved world: Add a story to the island that you discover as you explore. Perhaps you could include a 'survivor's journal' that you could copy this story into as you find it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you come up with any other ideas on your own, feel free to implement them! In fact, we could even combine everyone's ideas together at the end to make an awesome game with all of these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## We need a game controller...\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for this to work, we will need a loop to play our game. I've included a loop here that should work with the solution from the lesson this morning. We'll need to use our classes from the morning lesson, so I've pasted them here, too.\n",
    "\n",
