For those of you who don't aren't familiar with RoShamBo, or need a quick refresher, here's a short (and rather funny) video explaining how to play the game, among a few other things...\n",

What types of operations in your code would you need to do this and where in your code do you think they should go (you don't need to know the coding terms here, just use English to describe things like \"animate a hand\" or something similar)? Think back to the games you've played about the best way to make the game fun and accessible. We will learn more complex control structures and data types in the coming days, and be able to implement some of these ideas before the class is over.\n",
