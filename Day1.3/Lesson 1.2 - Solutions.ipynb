    "Last lesson, we worked with variables and operations to manipulate them, and yesterday you put together some massive combos to inflict upon our poor Practice Dummy. However, to test your combos, you had to do what I'll call the Brute Force method, trying things over and over and over again until you get the results that you want. This required an astounding amount of coding to get simple results (though you were likely only executing one line at a time). But there is an easier way. \n",
