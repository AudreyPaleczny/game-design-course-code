## Intro to Video Game AI

## OOP Continued with Escape the Island

## Activity - Escape the Island Class Upgrades and Monster AI

1. Now that we've improved Escape the Island to work like a full application, you are tasked with adding your changes from yesterday's activity to the new code structure
1. If you want a bit more of a challenge, add a wandering monster to your game! This is most easily achieved by creating a new class for your monster, instantiating the monster in every new game, moving it to a new location each day, and checking to see if the monster and the player are in the same space at any time. You can make this behavior deterministic (the monster follows a pattern), random (the monster can be anywhere at any time), or intelligent (the monster tries to predict where the player will be). It may also be helpful to also create a player class to track player location (it will look like the monster class!). This is also an easy way to add things like health, fighting, etc. Feel free to partner up to make it happen!
1. Be prepared to present any extensions you've made to the game in stand-up on Monday. 

Method:
	Students follow the lecture in the VSCode IDE, then complete the Activity described above.

Learning Goals:

	A deeper understanding of Classes and Methods
    A basic understanding of larger app structure

Notes:

	Lecture 1.5 is the first lecture that we won't be using the Jupyter Notebook and instead will be using only the VSCode IDE.
    We will be running our code in the terminal
    There is some copy/pasting involved, so pay attention, and speak up if you miss a step!
