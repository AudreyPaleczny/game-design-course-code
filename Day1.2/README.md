## Types and Python Syntax

Run the `Lesson 1.2.ipynb` notebook by right clicking the file and selecting "Open in Notebook Editor"

## Activity - Lots of Koans
Before tomorrow, you are expected to have completed the following koans:

1. `about_strings.py`
1. `about_string_manipulation.py`
1. `about_lists.py`
1. `about_list_assignments.py`
1. `about_tuples.py`
1. `about_dictionaries.py`

### How To Run the Koans
We'll want to be able to see our code AND the output at the same time, so we will open a terminal here in VSCode by pressing `ctrl/cmd + shift + ~` (windows/mac). Alternatively, you can click `Terminal -> New Terminal` in the top navbar. 

1. Move the assigned Koans from the "additional_koans" folder to the "koans" folder.
1. Navigate to the `python_koans` folder in the terminal: `cd ./python_koans`
1. Run the koans: 
    1. Windows: `python contemplate_koans.py`
    1. Mac: `./run.sh`
1. Open the file with the failing koan (`about_asserts.py`) and start editing!

**Bonus Activity!** "Who can make the biggest combo" challenge game! Before class tomorrow, we will see which of the participants in this game managed to pull off the biggest combo for each of the 3 classes: swordsman, archer, and wizard. Run the `Activity 1.2 - Who can make the biggest combo.ipynb` notebook by right clicking the file and selecting "Open in Notebook Editor". This activity is optional, but fun!
