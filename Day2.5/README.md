# Beardman Platformer

Today is our last day of the course! We have a special surprise in store for today. I've coded the skeleton of a platformer style game (think mario) that we will use for some fun, group game design. First, we will go over the code as written, so everyone gets a basic understanding of how the platformer works. Then, we will take some suggestions from the class on features to implement and add them together!

## Activity

Beardman Free Design

Be sure to complete the course survey!

Otherwise, no other official task! Play around with Beardman and learn about platformers.

Thanks for taking part in SPCS Game Design!

Method:
	Students are given the beardmangame.py, beardman.py, dungeonmap.py, and dungeontile.py files. We review the code in class. Together, we add a feature to the game. 

Learning Goals:

	Introduce the basic structure of a platformer in Pygame
	Continue to improve understanding of Classes and Methods in game structure
	Show the process of adding new features to games
