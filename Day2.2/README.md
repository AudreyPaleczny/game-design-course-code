# Wormy

Today we will be coding a clone of the classic game "Snake". Our clone will be called "Wormy", because reasons. This is the first "live action" game we'll be making, that you play using the keyboard and reacting to events on screen! This will require nearly all the skills we've learned so far, but we're going to leave `classes` out of today's lecture for ease of understanding of the implementation of the game.

## Activity: Wormy Extension

For today's activity, you will be adding at least one new feature to Wormy! Pick one or more of the ideas I've added to the instructions doc to implement. The instructions can be found on the linked google doc:

1. [Activity 2.2 Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IUgFyHVejkIUD0auUuoFMS0upZoWfxKwzyDO-M8jdS4/edit?usp=sharing)

Method:
	Students follow along as I code the wormy.py file. The activity is to freely expand upon the code we wrote in class

Learning Goals:

	First game in Pygame
	First individual exploration of Pygame
