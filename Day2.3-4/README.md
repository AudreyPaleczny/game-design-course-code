# Space Shooter

Over the next two lessons, we will implement the code to make a top-down, arcade-like space shooter game! This is a long and involved lecture, and will require us to use all the tools and knowledge we've learned so far to make the most our most thrilling game yet.

Method:
	Students follow along as I code the spaceshootergame.py, asteroid.py, laser.py, ship.py, and background.py files. The coding of the game takes 2 lecture periods. The activity on day 2 of this lecture is to expand upon our source code.

Learning Goals:

	Use Classes and Methods in Pygame
	Solidify understanding of Classes, Methods, and Functions
	Practice expanding on Classes and Methods
