Method:
	Students follow along as I code the spaceshootergame.py, asteroid.py, laser.py, ship.py, and background.py files. The coding of the game takes 2 lecture periods. The afternoon activity on day 2 of this lecture is to expand upon our source code.

Learning Goals:

	Use Classes and Methods in Pygame
	Solidify understanding of Classes, Methods, and Functions
	Practice expanding on Classes and Methods
